# Private Synthetic Data Generation Made Easy: Out-of-the-Box with Docker, Argilla & Ollama

> "Empowering organizations with a turnkey solution for synthetic dataset creation in private environments."

The increasing adoption of AI solutions across industries has created an unprecedented demand for high-quality training data. As organizations scale their AI initiatives, they face the dual challenge of generating substantial, domain-specific datasets while ensuring data privacy and security. Traditional approaches often involve compromises: either using public datasets that may not fully align with specific needs, or investing heavily in custom data generation infrastructure.

The complexity of this challenge is amplified by regulatory requirements, resource constraints, and the need for specialized expertise. Organizations must navigate GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations while maintaining efficient data generation pipelines. This has created a pressing need for solutions that can operate entirely within private infrastructure while maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities.

## The Challenge

The development of AI models requires extensive training data, yet organizations face significant obstacles in data generation and management. Privacy regulations and security requirements often prevent the use of public datasets or cloud-based generation services. Additionally, existing solutions typically demand complex infrastructure setups and significant technical expertise, increasing both implementation time and costs.

Modern enterprises require a solution that addresses several critical aspects:
1. Data Privacy: Complete control over data generation and storage
2. Infrastructure Flexibility: Deployment options that fit existing systems
3. Quality Assurance: Tools for data validation and curation
4. Scalability: Ability to grow with increasing data needs
5. Cost Efficiency: Reduction in infrastructure and maintenance costs

## The Solution

This out-of-the-box Synthetic Dataset Generator approach leverages the power of three technologies to create a seamless, private data generation pipeline. At its core is the [Synthetic Dataset Generator](https://github.com/argilla-io/synthetic-data-generator), a tool designed for dataset creation. [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) ensures secure local LLM inference with [Distilabel](https://github.com/argilla-io/distilabel) integration, while [Argilla's](https://argilla.io/) data curation capabilities complete the workflow, all operating within your secure infrastructure.

This architecture delivers key technical advantages:
- Full data sovereignty with containerized local deployment
- End-to-end pipeline from generation to validation
- Modular design for system integration

Here's how it all fits together:

Let's explore how these components work together in a practical workflow.

## 1. Installation & Setup



### 1.1 Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/argilla-io/synthetic-data-generator
cd synthetic-data-generator
```

### 1.2 Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp docker/.env.docker.template .env

# Model configuration in .env (if using Ollama)
MODEL="deepseek-r1:1.5b"  # Must match Ollama model name
```

### 1.3 Build & Deploy Services
> Pro tip: Even if you're planning to use just one component initially, we recommend building all services to enable future functionality without rebuilding. For detailed deployment options, check the [Docker documentation](https://github.com/argilla-io/synthetic-data-generator/blob/main/docker/README.md).

> Note: Ollama runs on CPU/GPU for Linux/Windows in Docker. For macOS, only CPU is supported in Docker - for GPU support, install Ollama separately ([details](https://ollama.com/blog/ollama-is-now-available-as-an-official-docker-image)).

```bash
# Build all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/ollama/compose.yml -f docker/argilla/compose.yml build
# Start all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/ollama/compose.yml -f docker/argilla/compose.yml up -d
```

To view logs, either:
- Use Docker Desktop's interface
- Remove the `-d` flag when running the above command
- Or execute the following for specific service logs:
  ```bash
  # Core App logs
  docker compose logs -f app
  # Ollama logs
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/ollama/compose.yml logs -f ollama
  # Argilla logs
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker/argilla/compose.yml logs -f argilla
  ```

## 2. Dataset Generation

The tool currently supports **Text Classification**, **Chat**, and **RAG** datasets. These tasks will determine the type of dataset you will generate: classification requires categories, chat data requires a conversation format, and RAG requires question-answer pairs with relevant context, offering options for both retrieval and reranking data generation to enhance different aspects of information retrieval systems.

For a detailed overview of the generation process, check out the [introduction to the Synthetic Data Generator](https://huggingface.co/blog/synthetic-data-generator).


### 2.1. **Dataset Description**

   Let's walk through creating a **RAG dataset**.
   ```text
   A dataset to retrieve information from information security policies
   ```

   System initializes and processes the prompt:
   ![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64461026e1fd8d65b27e6187/sxH8JChF-HnGMOilymYpA.png)


### 2.2. **Task Configuration & Sample Generation**
   System analyzes and generates the system prompt and optimal parameters automatically. Then, samples are generated for validation (modify system prompt or parameters manually if needed, then click save to generate sample data):
   ![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64461026e1fd8d65b27e6187/mYVlGNnz6YNrPJutxmBtR.png)


### 2.3. **Full Dataset Generation**
After validating the sample data quality, proceed with full dataset generation. Configure the following parameters:

- **Repository Owner**: Your Hugging Face username for dataset hosting
- **Dataset Name**: A descriptive name following standard naming conventions
- **Number of Examples**: Define dataset size (recommended: 100-1000 for initial deployments)
- **Temperature**: Controls generation creativity (default 0.7 balances coherence and diversity)
- **Privacy Settings**: Optional dataset privacy configuration for Hugging Face Hub

The temperature parameter significantly impacts output quality:
- 0.5-0.7: Optimal for technical documentation and factual content
- 0.7-0.8: Balanced for general purpose datasets
- 0.8-1.0: Increased creativity, suitable for conversational data


The system initiates the generation pipeline, leveraging Distilabel for structured output:

Upon completion, the dataset is pushed to Hugging Face Hub:

## 3. Data Curation with Argilla

The integration with Argilla provides enterprise-grade dataset curation capabilities through a comprehensive review system. This phase is crucial for ensuring data quality and maintaining high standards in your training datasets.

### Environment Configuration
Before accessing Argilla's features, ensure proper configuration in your `.env` file.


### Curation Workflow

1. **Dataset Integration**
   Upon generation completion, the dataset is automatically ingested into Argilla. The system maintains data integrity and version control throughout the process. All datasets and progress persist across Docker restarts unless you explicitly remove the Argilla services and volumes.

2. **Quality Assurance Process**
   Argilla's interface provides comprehensive tools for dataset validation:
   - Semantic analysis of generated content
   - Consistency checking across entries
   - Metadata validation and enrichment
   - Collaborative review capabilities

3. **Dataset Publication**
   After thorough review, export your curated dataset to Hugging Face Hub:
   
   > Note: Consider using a new repository name to preserve both raw and curated datasets separately.
   
   - Configure repository settings
   - Set visibility and access controls
   - Add dataset cards and documentation
